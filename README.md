## Usage

This component can be used to read e-mails that comes outside the value-aware infrastructure.

## Deployment

The **C0 E-mail Sensor** is designed to run as a Docker container, working within the [Master Of VALAWAI (MOV)](https://valawai.github.io/docs/architecture/implementations/mov) ecosystem. For a complete guide, including advanced setups, refer to the [component's full deployment documentation](https://valawai.github.io/docs/components/C0/email_sensor/deploy).

Here's how to quickly get it running:

1. ### Build the Docker Image

    First, you need to build the Docker image. Go to the project's root directory and run:

    ```bash
    ./buildDockerImages.sh -t latest
    ```

    This creates the `valawai/c0_email_sensor:latest` Docker image, which is referenced in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

2. ### Start the Component

    You have two main ways to start the component:

    A. **With MOV and Mail Catcher (for testing):**
    To run the C0 E-mail Sensor with the MOV and a local email testing tool (Mail Catcher), use:

    ```bash
    COMPOSE_PROFILES=all docker compose up -d
    ```

    Once started, you can access:

    - **MOV:** [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
    - **RabbitMQ UI:** [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082) (credentials: `mov:password`)
    - **Mail Catcher UI:** [http://localhost:8083](http://localhost/8083)

    B. **As a Standalone Component (connecting to an existing MOV/RabbitMQ):**
    If you already have MOV running or want to connect to a remote RabbitMQ, you'll need a [`.env` file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/env-file/) with connection details. Create a `.env` file in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` like this:

    ```properties
    MOV_MQ_HOST=host.docker.internal
    MOV_MQ_USERNAME=mov
    MOV_MQ_PASSWORD=password
    C0_EMAIL_SENSOR_PORT=9080
    MAIL_WEB=9083
    ```

    Find full details on these and other variables in the [component's dedicated deployment documentation](https://valawai.github.io/docs/components/C0/email_sensor/deploy).
    Once your `.env` file is configured, start only the email sensor and mail catcher (without MOV) using:

    ```bash
    COMPOSE_PROFILES=mail,component docker compose up -d
    ```

3. ### Stop All Containers

    To stop all containers launched, run:

    ```bash
    COMPOSE_PROFILES=all docker compose down
    ```

    This command stops the MOV, RabbitMQ, and Mail Catcher containers.

## Development environment

To ensure a consistent and isolated development experience, this component is configured
to use Docker. This approach creates a self-contained environment with all the necessary
software and tools for building and testing, minimizing conflicts with your local system
and ensuring reproducible results.

You can launch the development environment by running this script:

```bash
./startDevelopmentEnvironment.sh
```

Once the environment starts, you'll find yourself in a bash shell, ready to interact with
the Quarkus development environment. You'll also have access to the following integrated tools:

- **Master of VALAWAI**: The central component managing topology connections between services.
 Its web interface is accessible at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).
- **RabbitMQ** The message broker for inter-component communication. The management web interface
 is at [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082), with credentials `mov**:**password`.
- **MongoDB**: The database used by the MOV, named `movDB`, with user credentials `mov:password`.
- **Mongo express**: A web interface for interacting with MongoDB, available at
 [http://localhost:8084](http://localhost:8084), also with credentials `mov**:**password`.
- **Mail catcher**A tool to capture and inspect sent emails. Its web interface is at
  [http://localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083).

Within this console, you can use the official [`quarkus` client](https://quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling#using-the-cli)
or any of these convenient commands:

- `startServer`: To initiate the development server.
- `mvn clean`: To clean the project (compiled and generated code).
- `mvn test`: To run all project tests.
- `mvn -DuseDevMOV=true test`: To execute tests using the already started Master of VALAWAI instance,
 rather than an independent container.
  
To exit the development environment, simply type `exit` in the bash shell or run the following script:

```bash
./stopDevelopmentEnvironment.sh
```

In either case, the development environment will gracefully shut down, including all activated services
like MOV, RabbitMQ, MongoDB, Mongo Express, and the Mail Catcher.
